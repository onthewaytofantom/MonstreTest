				Fantoman & Fantomonstre (FTM TESTNET)
			</h2>
<p>This is just to test the contract. Definitely not the final product. Not even close! The UI, animation, and interface will run with Unity Engine. The core and processing of the lives are fully running in the FTM contracts. <True-Web3>.</p>

<p>Mission: To have a new (unmanipulated and very low-risk)self-sustained way for Fantom users to earn extra income via a relaxing strategy game with creatures on the chain. That will keep Fantom's ecosystem users engaged and educated especially in the BEAR Market.</p>

<p>The grant is mainly used for 3rd party auditioning, building the community, and the development and operation costs before we can be self-sustained.</p>

<p>The project is to create living creatures that are fully built on the chain for relaxing gaming and much more. Fantoman (trainer) & Fantomonstre (creature) token complies with ERC721 standard and 'LifeCycle' (LNFT). It means they have their unique 'Life Cycle' in the contract (the law of life is immutable). The Fantomonstre started with an egg, grew, and evolve based on the training and food given with the transactions from time to time. It will die and resume back to an egg if not taken care of (you can also delegate/loan to another wallet) or get too old. It is a brand new concept that has 'living creatures' in the blockchain. FTM has the speed and very low fee to make this fully on-chain. Spent some time with your Fantomonstre and they will help you to earn $FTM via tournaments and leagues. These will help Fantom Opera to maintain user engagement through the bear market (It is like working at 'McDonald'). Since it is fully written in FTM contracts and stays in the blockchain forever, any project team could cross-collaborate with this project. E.g. Paintswap, 8BIT, etc.</p>

<p>The project is aimed at self-sustaining. The treasury will receive $FTM from the advertisement, social spending in the game, and tickets for events and tournaments and 100% of it will fund the reward for the Fantoman that raises their Fantomonstre and compete or work for the Fantom World (operate like decentralized Google, Facebook/Meta model). The project can be bootstrapped by any sponsors sending funds to the project treasury for the reward. Besides, the game will include an interesting, growing story based on the historical events that happened in Fantom, attracting, guiding, and educating new users about DeFi, risk, safety measures, etc.</p>

<p>I plan to have a fair launch minting and target the 'long tail' of Fantom users (small wallets, or new small investors who hold $FTM in their bags). No ERC20 token has been planned because it is easily been manipulated and is against my target audience. Only $FTM serves as the currency. In other words, it adds utility to $FTM too.</p>
